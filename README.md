# WinPython

## Introduction

WinPython is a simple Python virtual machine, which implements a subset of modern Python language.

This project was my final assignment for the software engineering course at my university, where I majored in computer science. 

Now since the course is over, I have decided to open source it.

I hope this project will help my classmates to better understand how Python works, and inspire them to further explore the related computer science knowledge.

## Build

You can use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 to build WinPython, which is very easy. 

Note that, since WinPython doesn't have its own compiler to convert the Python source code into byte code, it relies on the official Python compiler to do this. 

You can download the source code of official Python compiler [here](https://github.com/WU-SUNFLOWER/Python-Core), and compile it by Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

Then you will get a dll file, copy it to the same directory as the WinPython executable file you built, and finally you can run WinPython on your computer.
